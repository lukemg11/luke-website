    <figcaption> This is Bruno Fernandes, my favorite player. I admire his work ethic and dedication, and I think he is severely overhated.

    <figcaption> I play as a center midfielder, which means I operate in the middle of the field. It means a lot of passing and a lot of running!

          <td>Goalkeeper</td>
          <td>The final line of defense and the only player that can use their hands. Definitely the most stressful position.</td>

          <td>Defender</td>
          <td>Defenders try to prevent the attackers from getting past them and potentially scoring. It helps if they are strong and/or fast.</td>

          <td>Midfielder</td>
          <td>Midfielders need to be good at passing. Their main job is to link the defense and the attack. They need to have very good endurance and it helps to have good game IQ.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Attacker</td>
          <td>Attackers need to be good at finishing, as their main job is simply to score goals. It helps if they are fast and strong.</td>
